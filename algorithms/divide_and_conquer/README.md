# Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is a paradigm that involves breaking down the problem to be solved into several smaller subproblems. Each subproblem is solved using the same algorithm through recursion, and then the solved subproblems are combined to solve the main problem.

### Algorithms that Use the Divide and Conquer Paradigm

For some practical examples, let's take a look at a few algorithms that utilize this paradigm:

- [Binary Search](https://github.com/guihcodes/software-engineering-skills/tree/develop/algorithms/binary_search)

- [Quicksort](https://github.com/guihcodes/software-engineering-skills/tree/develop/algorithms/quicksort)

- [Mergesort](https://github.com/guihcodes/software-engineering-skills/tree/develop/algorithms/mergesort)

And many others...
